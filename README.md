![Power BI Dashboard](images/dashboard-preview.png)

## Project Overview

An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing South Africa's electricity generation mix and energy transition from 2000-2024. This project demonstrates the complete data analytics pipeline from raw data to actionable insights.

## Key Insights

- **Coal Dominance:** Persistent reliance on coal, declining slightly from 73% to 72% of generation
- **Renewable Growth:** Solar and wind power grew from near 0% to over 3% of the energy mix
- **Demand Increase:** Total electricity generation increased by 15% over the period
- **Transition Pace:** Visualization of the beginning of South Africa's renewable energy transition

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI** - Data visualization and dashboard development
- **Power Query** - Data transformation and cleaning
- **DAX** - Custom measures and calculations
- **Excel** - Initial data exploration
